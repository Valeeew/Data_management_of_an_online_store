> ## Purpose

This project help me to get the best practices in the use of Pandas DATA cleaning
I was evaluated on the following three points:
- Manage errors and inconsistencies in stored data
- Be careful with the data join
- Perform univariate analysis to interpret data


> ## What I learned

- Merge my data correctly
- Outliers Detection
- Data cleaning

> ## Areas of improvement

Always make a PowerPoint to present my work, a Notebook isn't enough !
